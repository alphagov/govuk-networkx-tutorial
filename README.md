# govuk-networkx-tutorial
A tutorial to learn some basic network science and networkx functionality with GOV.UK structural network.


Click on the "Open in Colab" button to get started. Select a notebook to make a copy of. This uses the latest version 
of networkx.  

Note: you will miss out on some of the visualisation using this approach,
 as some of the dependencies of holoviews and bokeh are difficult to install on Google Colab.
  This code will error, ignore and move on.
